This shared object (.so) runs automatically when loaded. It creates a reverse shell to a specified IP and port, 
It redirects standard input, output, and error to the remote socket. It loads /bin/sh into memory using memfd_create() and executes it entirely from RAM with fexecve(). This method leaves no trace on disk and runs quietly in memory. 


so, the /bin/sh excuted from memory rather from disk this is the best area..
